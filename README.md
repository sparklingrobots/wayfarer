Wayfarer
=======================

Code: https://github.com/sparklingrobots/wayfarer

What Is This?
-------------

This module creates a "Travel Alert" block. The user can provide their travel 
destination, arrival date, departure date, and scheduling link to populate 
the block. This way an individual can easily and quickly offer face-to-face 
meetings as they travel. 

Best practices at this point are to provide a link to a service like Acuity 
Scheduling where guests can create their own appointment, or to provide a
contact link so that they may reach out to schedule. 

How To Use The Module
-----------------------

There are three main ways to interact with the examples in this project:

1. Enable the module.

2. Place the block in the desired region from Drupal's block admin screen. 

3. On the block configuration screen, fill out the fields for destination, dates
   and scheduling.
